# Ship Game

A 2D sandbox ship game built with HTML and TypeScript.

## Features

- **Mouse-aimed ship** – your ship always points toward the cursor
- **Relative WASD movement** – W: forward thrust, S: backward thrust, A: strafe left, D: strafe right
- **8-slot toolbar** – navigate with the scroll wheel or press 1–8
- **Open world** – procedurally generated asteroid fields that grow denser and rarer the further from the origin
- **Block-based asteroids** – composed of 6 material types (Rock → Iron → Gold → Crystal → Titanium → Darkite) each with unique hardness and rarity
- **Enemy ships** – 4 tiers that scale with distance from origin (Scout, Fighter, Cruiser, Capital Ship); patrol until the player is spotted, then chase and attack
- **Resource collection** – shoot/mine asteroids to collect materials
- **Crafting system** – open with **C** to combine materials into weapons and upgrades
- **HUD** – health bar, shield bar, XP bar, level, world coordinates
- **XP & Levelling** – earn XP by destroying enemies; level up to gain +10 max HP and +5 max shield per level
- **Camera shake** – screen shakes when the player takes damage
