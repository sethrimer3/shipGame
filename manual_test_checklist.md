# Manual Test Checklist

- [ ] Launch game and confirm build number is visible at bottom-left.
- [ ] Open crafting menu and craft at least two different weapon recipes.
- [ ] Open ship editor and verify per-item crafted modules appear in the palette.
- [ ] Drag crafted modules into ship layout and save.
- [ ] Fire equipped crafted weapons and confirm damage/firing still works.
- [ ] Upgrade a crafted module in the palette context menu and verify upgrade feedback.
- [ ] Recycle a crafted module and confirm partial resource refund appears.
- [ ] Fly near origin and confirm a large circular station surrounds the spawn area.
- [ ] Verify white infinity modules are visible at station center and are not destroyed by enemy fire.
- [ ] Lure enemies toward the station and confirm station turrets automatically fire at them.
- [ ] Let enemies damage the station modules and confirm modules can be destroyed.
- [ ] Die, use rebirth (`R` on desktop), and verify station is fully restored.
- [ ] Before dying, collect both gems and non-gem resources; after rebirth confirm only gems remain.
- [ ] Save a ship layout with crafted modules, die/restart, then verify auto-crafting rebuilds modules from connected inner slots outward as resources are collected.

- [ ] Die and verify the death overlay shows `[Rebirth (R)]` on desktop and `[Rebirth]` on mobile.
- [ ] Trigger rebirth and verify a flash appears first, then the ship procedurally rebuilds outward from the core.
