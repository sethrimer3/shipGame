ORIGINAL GAME PROMPT: Create the framework for an HTML and TypeScript 2D sandbox ship game. The ship points toward the player's mouse and moves relative to the mouse with WASD (w for forward thrust, s for backward thrust, a for strafe left, d for strafe right). There is a toolbar with 8 spaces that the player can navigate with the scroll wheel or by pressing 12345678. It's an open-world game, full of asteroids composed of blocks of different materials, enemy ships that fly around and attack the player on sight, and the player can customize their ship and craft different weapons and upgrades from resources they collect. The further the player flies from their initial spawn, the larger the enemy ships and the more prevalent rare resources are.
